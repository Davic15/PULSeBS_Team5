## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  we underestimated the amount of time needed to code stories number 10 and 11, expecially regarding the sql queries needed on server side and the chart components on client side.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  we should be more time conservative when evaluating tasks and stories so that we don't need to overwork to deliver the demo. it's better to deliver less stories but complete them all in time.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  we were able to measure time spent better by a more careful task identification 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  We still didn't compute a value for coverage because we run out of time to do it

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  be more careful about story commitment and be sure that if we commit one we will deliver it in time

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  we are proud of the fact that we improved our team work.
