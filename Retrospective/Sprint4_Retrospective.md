## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  we had some spare hours because we didn't feel comfortable adding  new stories we weren't sure to complete for the last demo

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  last sprint we decided not to implement a feedback from a stakeholder because it didn't fit our view on the project, in this new demo we received a similar feedback so we probably should have tried to find a way to make that feeback fit in the project

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  Thanks to the careful planning work in previous sprints we managed to reuse some of our old code with small changes to implement also new stories without much work
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  We think we more or less achieved all previous goals regarding scrum way of working
  
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  We are proud of the fact that we managed to complete a good chunk of the stories without overworking too much despite the fact that our team was composed of less people than others
