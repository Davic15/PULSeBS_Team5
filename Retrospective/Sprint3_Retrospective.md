## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  this time we feel like we improved in estimating tasks and there are no big mistakes

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  We learnt that our previous overestimations were actually the most correct estimation, so we learned to take into accout a bigger time than the one that immediatly comes to mind 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  we were able to estimate time better and were able to complete all the stories and estimate coverage
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  we estimated coverage but couldn't make it show up on sonarcloud

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  Deliver a working and stable final release of this project by extensive testing and code review

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  We are proud of the fact that sprint after sprint we feel like we are improving our work and we are understanding SCRUM better
